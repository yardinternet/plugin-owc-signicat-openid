# OWC Signicat OpenID

2. Gutenberg block to insert a Signicat OpenID login button
3. GravityForm fields to insert a Signicat OpenID login button
4. JavaScript to show a session expiration modal

You can use this plugin outside GravityForms as well, but you should handle the "Gate" middleware yourself, you should be able to do this by reading the `OWC_Signicat_OpenID\Session`.
